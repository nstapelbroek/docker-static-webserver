# Set a strict Referrer Policy to mitigate information leakage.
#
# (1) The `Referrer-Policy` header is included in responses for resources
#     that are able to request (or navigate to) other resources.
#
#     This includes the commonly used resource types:
#     HTML, CSS, XML/SVG, PDF documents, scripts and workers.
#
# To prevent referrer leakage entirely, specify the `no-referrer` value
# instead. Note that the effect could impact analytics metrics negatively.
#
# To check your Referrer Policy, you can use an online service, such as:
